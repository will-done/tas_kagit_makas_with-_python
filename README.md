# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! This simple Python game allows you to play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. 

# Game Overview
The game follows the traditional rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
The first player to win two rounds wins the game.
The game provides feedback on each round and allows you to play multiple games.

# Features
Play Again Option: After each game, you have the option to play another round or exit.
Humorous Messages: The game includes humorous messages for different outcomes.
Score Tracking: The game tracks the number of rounds won by both the player and the computer.

# Make Your Choice :

When the game starts, we have three options: Rock, Paper and Scissors.
As the first player, we type one of these to make our choice. Then the computer will choose a random move and the winner of the round will be shown on the screen.
If an invalid expression is entered, we will be presented with the option to choose again.

# Play Again :

After each game, you will be asked if you want to play another round.
The computer will also "decide" and if both of you want to continue, the game will continue. If one of you does not want to continue, the game will end. We enter our own choice and the computer's choice is random.

# Development Process
Step 1: Game Logic
We created the core logic of the game, which includes functions to receive the computer’s choice, determine the winner, and verify the player’s choice.

Step 2: Humor and Finishing Touches
To make the game more fun, we added humorous messages and emojis for different outcomes.
We also implemented a scoring system that tracks the number of rounds won by the player and the computer.

Step 3: Final Tests
Finally, we ran tests to make sure the game worked smoothly and provided an enjoyable experience for the user.
